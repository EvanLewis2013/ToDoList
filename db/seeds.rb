# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create(
  #   [
  #     { name: "Star Wars" },
  #     { name: "Lord of the Rings" }
  #   ]
  # )
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# tasks = Task.create(
#   { name: "Get up"},
#   { name: "Find pants"}
# )

task1 = Task.create(name: "Get Up")
task2 = Task.create(name: "Find pants")
